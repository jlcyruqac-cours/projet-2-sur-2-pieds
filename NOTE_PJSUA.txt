Added files for most-voip (compiled for python 2.7 32-bits)

.\venv\Lib\site-packages

_pjsua.pyd
libpjproject.lib
pjlib.lib
pjsua.py
pjsua.pyc
pjsua-2.9_svn-py2.7.egg-info

For some reasons, it won't compile in x64 with python 2.7 or 3.8
Might do more investigation.

Compiled using VS2019 with Tools v140 installed (C++ 2015) and Windows 8.1 SDK

Tried 1001 times to compile with GCC on GNU but could build dependencies correctly :(

Important, build target must match python installation.
Add Additional header files and libraries in C++ linker in VS in order to compile
Project to use is called 'python_pjsua'
In .\pjsip-apps\src\python\ , run "py -2.7 setup-vc.py install" to install after compiles .pyd.
Copy files in C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages to our virtual env.

This took me an entire day and it almost made me go crazy lol.
