   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Getting Started 
===============

The following tutorial shows you the main features of the library on the Android platform. 

This tutorial assumes that you have installed and configured the `Asterisk Sip Server <http://www.asterisk.org/>`_
on a reachable PC. For getting  instructions about the Asterisk configuration click `here <../../asterisk_docs/asterisk_configuration.html>`_ 

Alternatively, you can download a virtual machine containing a running Asterisk Server instance  already configured for running the proposed android examples, as explained `here <../../asterisk_docs/vm_asterisk_installation.html>`_
