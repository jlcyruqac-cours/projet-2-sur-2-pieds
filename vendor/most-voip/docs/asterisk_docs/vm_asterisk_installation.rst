VM Asterisk Installation
========================

To install the Virtual Machine containing an instance of the Asterisk Server (needed for running all the  available python and android examples), do the following steps:

 * install and run `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/installation/>`_ 
 * Open a terminal and, from the  *docker* folder, run the script *most_voip_asterisk_builder.sh*.
 
 That script will install a new Virtual Machine on your pc , with an already configured and running Asterisk Server instance, and will open the Asterisk interactive console.
